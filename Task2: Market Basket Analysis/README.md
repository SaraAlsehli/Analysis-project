Simplified explanation :
It is a data analysis related to purchases on the “Instacart” platform, where users’ behavior in shopping for products online is analyzed. 
Frequently purchased products
Times when orders are made (such as morning, evening, or weekdays).
Buying habits such as the products users prefer and their purchasing patterns.
The primary goal is to understand customer preferences and purchasing behavior to improve recommendations and user experience on the shopping platform.

•  Dataset:
 It includes multiple files such as "aisles," "departments," "order_products," "orders," and "products." These files provide details about products, departments, product categories, as well as order and purchase details.
In the initial steps, libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib are used for data visualization. This includes displaying top-selling products through charts.

•  Model:
The "Apriori" model from mlxtend.frequent_patterns is employed to extract association rules, revealing product combinations frequently purchased together.
 The data is transformed into a matrix format using TransactionEncoder, enabling its application in the Apriori model.

•  data preprocessing steps:

   1- Product Filtering: Selecting top-selling products and filtering the data to retain only frequently purchased items. 
   
   2- Data Transformation: Using TransactionEncoder to convert product data within orders into a binary matrix, allowing for the application of the Apriori model.
   
  3- Rule Filtering: After extracting association rules, the results are filtered based on confidence and lift values.
