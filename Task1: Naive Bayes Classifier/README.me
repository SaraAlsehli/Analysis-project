Simplified explanation :

Analyzing and classifying breast cancer-related data using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.
Classification of tumors into benign or malignant using data on diagnostic characteristics of tumors, and aims to build a model that can predict the type of tumor based on a set of features.

•  Dataset:
The data includes information about cancer cells, such as various measurements of the shape and size of the cells.
   The data set contains several columns, including (diagnosis), which indicates whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

•  Model:
The model used is (Gaussian Naive Bayes), which is a type of "Naive Bayes" algorithm designed to deal with data that follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution. 

Gaussian Naive Bayes was chosen to classify the tumor as (benign or malignant) based on cell characteristics, such as size and shape.

•  data preprocessing steps:
Data cleaning: Remove unnecessary columns such as "Unnamed: 32" and "id."
Data Splitting: Separating the data set into a training and testing set to verify the efficiency of the model.
